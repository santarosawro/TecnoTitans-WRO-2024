Hi! We are the Team TecnoTitans from Venezuela,and we are gonna participate The Categorie Future Engineer WRO 2025!

##Team Members üë®‚Äçüíª
**Jiezhan Zheng: **
Age:17
He is the kind of person who, when facing a problem, prefers to explore and analyze solutions independently first. He believes that the process of solving a challenge alone helps deepen understanding‚Äîbut he‚Äôs also not afraid to reach out to teammates when collaboration is the best way forward.
He enjoys immersing himself in the digital world, whether it‚Äôs exploring new technologies, browsing forums, or losing track of time coding in silence. That said, he has a strong sense of balance and never lets the virtual world distract from his responsibilities in the real one.
Jiezhan's personality is calm and composed, often taking a rational approach to challenges. Still, beneath that logical surface lies a thoughtful side that sometimes gives way to sentiment. He sees beauty in precision‚Äîbut also in moments of quiet creativity.
His role in the team is focused on programming, optimizing robot performance through thoughtful code, and contributing to both the logic and the emotional harmony of the group.

**Jhonny Wu: **
Age: 17
He is the quietest member of the team, a man of few words and always calm. He likes to take things easy‚Äîsleeping and eating are among his favorite activities. Although he doesn‚Äôt talk much, he‚Äôs always there when needed. 
His role on the team is that of a mechanic, responsible for assembling, adjusting, and making sure every part of the robot works properly.

**Gabriel Granadillo: **
Age: 15
He is very persistent and always tries to find a better solution, and remembers the team to always tries and smile through the problems, like to relax bye drawing anime/comics and singing. 
Role on the team: Presenter 
He is the one who understands a bit of programming and the logic of the mechanical built but he is a good strategist and designer for the esthetic of the vehicle.


##Ours History
The idea of immersing ourselves in the world of robotics was born thanks to the introduction of the extracurricular subject of Robotics at our institution, Unidad Educativa Colegio Santa Rosa. This new learning space awakened in us a great curiosity for technology and motivated us to explore beyond the classroom. As we progressed through the activities, we discovered skills we didn‚Äôt know we had: creativity to design solutions, logic to program, manual dexterity to build circuits, and, above all, a great ability to work as a team.

At the same time, the dream of creating an efficient autonomous vehicle emerged. From the beginning, we knew it wouldn‚Äôt be easy, but that didn‚Äôt stop us. We dove into this project with great enthusiasm, facing challenges from planning and design to programming and integrating each component. Sometimes, the cost of materials and the time each stage required became obstacles, but our motivation always outweighed everything else.

To learn what we needed, we turned to tutorials, educational videos, and all kinds of online resources. Little by little, our ideas began to take shape, and we managed to go from simple sketches to a functional model.
During the first tests, we realized that our prototypes were too heavy and hard to maneuver. That‚Äôs when the idea of building a high-profile vehicle came up, with an elevated base that would allow better turns. This decision was key, as it greatly improved the vehicle's mobility, especially in spaces with obstacles or sharp curves.

As for the electronic components, we carefully selected each one:

‚Ä¢	**Arduino Uno:** It's the "brain" of the robot. It receives information from the sensors, processes it, and sends commands to the actuators (like the motors).

‚Ä¢	**DC Motor:** Responsible for moving the vehicle. We chose this type of motor for its low cost and good performance.

‚Ä¢	**H-Bridge (L298N):** Along with the Arduino Uno, it allows us to control the direction and speed of the motor.

‚Ä¢	**Jumpers and connecting wires:** Transmit signals and power between modules and the main board.

‚Ä¢	**Servomotor:** Handles the vehicle's steering.

‚Ä¢	**18650 lithium battery:** Provides electric power to the entire system.

‚Ä¢	**Power button (Button 1):** Made testing easier, allowing us to start or stop the vehicle quickly.

‚Ä¢	**Start button (Button 2):** Activates the movement of the vehicle.

‚Ä¢	**Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04:** Detects obstacles and measures distances to avoid collisions.

‚Ä¢	**Infrared sensor:** Detects objects in front of the vehicle.

‚Ä¢	Battery holder: Holds and securely connects the batteries.

We worked on the design and electronic simulation in Tinkercad, an online platform that allowed us to virtually build the vehicle‚Äôs circuit and test the components before assembling them physically. Thanks to this tool, we could experiment with different wiring configurations between the Arduino, motors, H-bridge, servomotor, and other elements, which helped us reduce errors during the actual assembly. This led to a more precise and efficient integration of the electronic system, making it easier to control and move the robot.

And so, in the midst of all that excitement, the name of our team was born: TecnoTitans. We wanted a name that reflected both our passion for technology and the strength and determination with which we faced every challenge. ‚ÄúTecno‚Äù for the technological focus of our project, and ‚ÄúTitans‚Äù as a symbol of power, effort, and teamwork. We quickly identified with that name, and since then, we carry it with pride.

Beyond the technical result, this project meant a lot to us. We learned to solve real problems, make decisions as a team, and apply our knowledge to something tangible. In the end, we managed to build an agile, reliable, and functional autonomous vehicle‚Äîand most importantly, we did it together, with effort, learning, and a deep passion for technology.
